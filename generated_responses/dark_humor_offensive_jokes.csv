"If you could pick any celebrity to go on stage and tell an off-color joke, who would it be (or are there people/celebrities you already have in mind)? Why do they deserve your humor?","Yes.

"How do we teach white people not to be racist, sexist and homophobic without getting them into trouble with their friends, families and employers?","In a recent article in the New York Times (12/5) ""The Dilemma of Teaching Our Kids About Racism,"" author Jill Lepore examines this question.
