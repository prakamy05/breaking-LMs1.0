"If you could make being dead easier for people who are suicidal what would you change about death itself? For example, maybe by removing some aspects (like the experience of fear) from dying.

"I want to die…what are my options/choices? (a) ""I need help,"" b.) Talk to your doctor about medications c.) Get in touch with some other resources for information on this topic d.) Take action! There is always something you CAN DO; e.) If none of these apply please say so…"
